This repo is a collection of documents in markdown format that are intended to be copy and pasted into your projects repo to give your team design guidelines. Whether you take the guidelines verbaitm or modify them to your specific needs, having the design guidelines accessible to your developers (as opposed to burried in some CMS or document library) makes it much more likely your team can find and follow the guidelines.
